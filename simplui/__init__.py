"""simplui - a minimal GUI toolkit for pyglet

Intended purely as a tool for developers, to allow the
quick addition of GUIs for configuration and debug displays.

--------------------

See 'demo.py' in the enclosing directory for a brief tutorial.

--------------------

* Root element:
    The root GUI element must be a Frame, and the frame takes care
    of event handling:
    
    frame = Frame(w=window.width, h=window.height)
    window.push_handlers(frame)
    
    Every element has a name, which may be specified as a keyword
    argument to the constructor. You can use the frame to retrieve
    any named element:
    
    frame.add( Label('some text', name='my_label') )
    e = frame.get_element_by_name('my_label')
    
    Note that names must be unique within a single frame
    
* Containers:
    There are two types of containers provided by the library,
    list and single.
    
    List containers can contain an arbitrary number of elements,
    including other containers. The list containers provided are:
    
    + Container - pixel positioning, does not auto-resize
    + VerticalLayout - arranges elements vertically, auto-resizes
                                         to fit contents
    
    Single containers can contain only a single item, typically
    another container. If you do not provide a content element,
    a Container will be created for you. The single containers
    provided are:
    
    + Dialogue - floating window, resizes to fit contents
    + FoldingBox - vertically collapsible box, resizes to fit contents

* Controls:
    A limitted set of controls is provided:
    
    + Label - simple textual label
    + Button - clickable button
    + Checkbox - clickable 2-state checkbox, with text label
    + TextInput - editable text field
    + Slider - simple value slider
    
    Each of Button, Checkbox, TextInput and Slider have an action attribute.
    The action is a callback which will be invoked when the control is
    used (clicking for button or checkbox, end enditing for text input).
    The action may be provided as a keyword argument to the constructor:
    
    button = Button('Click Me!', action=my_function)
