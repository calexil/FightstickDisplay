# Prerequisites
* python(2.7+)

# Installation & Usage
**Linux**
* Clone the git  
`git clone https://github.com/calexil/FightstickDisplay.git`
* If you desire, make a launcher with fightstick.sh as the start script.
* To bring up the deadzone menu hit **Spacebar**.
* Most fightsticks will be mapped correctly by default, but if yours is not
simply open the **theme/layout.ini** file and tinker with it until its mapped correctly.
Usually only the rt/lt/rb/lb buttons get mixed up a little. If your fightstick is not detected
at all, let us know!
* You can also use your own images for all items, and if you like different color buttons, just be sure to edit the image names to match in the main program
* Enjoy
