Open gimp and open the bg image

drag in the button image and reposition it to where it should be, then note the coordinates of the lower left most corner or the image

the x coordinate stays the same, the y coordinate needs to be changed by subtracting it from 390

ie: lower left coord.= 244,126
corrected position is 244, 264
